## Project Proposal Example using 2019 Data

Dr. Love has completed an R Markdown file and compiled it into an HTML result which you can view now, and which he **strongly** encourages you to use in developing your own proposal. The files may be found in [our Github Repository](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/projectA/README.md)

- Dr. Love's [R Markdown file](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/projectA/love-example-projectA-proposal.Rmd) is a strong starting point for the development of your proposal.
    - Remember to click Raw if you want to download the R Markdown file from that link.
    - This file is also part of the [431-data repository](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data) we've used for labs and other data and code, so you can also get it from there.
- The resulting HTML file can be viewed at https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/projectA-proposal-example-431-2021, which may be easier for you to read and will also show you what your final result should look like.
